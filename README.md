## Textbook (required):

Mastering Responsive Web Design: Push your HTML and CSS skills to the limit and build professional grade, responsive websites
<cite>by Ricardo Zea</cite>

Available at the College Bookstore.<br>
**ISBN-10:** 1783550236<br>
**ISBN-13:** 978-1783550234<br>
And also on [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Responsive-Web-Design-Ricardo/dp/1783550236/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491179215&sr=8-1&keywords=mastering+responsive+design)

## Assignments/Projects

Regular assignments building up to the final project will be posted in Canvas. All assignments are designed to give the student practice with new skills, concepts, and tools covered in class.

Your homework must be turned in on time. Late submissions may be granted partial credit when accompanied by an ingenuitive excuse. Generally speaking, students will learn more if coursework is up-to-date with the lecture. Unfortunately, assignments turned in after course end will receive 0 points. 

To receive full credit, your completed assignment should perform the required functionality and, if specified, use the techniques learned during class. Additionally, all code must meet coding style guidelines. 

Students will have 1 additional week to correct code rejected for not meeting style guidelines. 

Assignments leading up to the final project will constitute half of the final grade. The final project itself will constitue the remaining half.

## Quizzes/Exams

There will occassionally be quizzes designed to test knowledge retention and evaluate class progression. These will be administered through Canvas and will constitute no more than 10% of the final grade.

As this course is project-based, there will be no exams.

## Evaluation (subject to change)

Evaluation will be based on Assignments, Quizzes, and the Final Project.

## Materials

USB Drive or Cloud Storage and/or Personal Laptop.

A private Web Server may be helpful, but is not required.

## Attendance 

While regular attendance is not technically mandatory, in practice, it usually is. This is by design to mimic “real life” scenarios. Often times, showing up is the most important thing. And being present for lectures, quizzes, and code reviews will greatly improve your grade.  

This is a programming class and you need to be prepared to work hard and to spend an adequate amount of time outside of the classroom coding.   

## Helping / Working with Others

I encourage you to work with other class members, which is how real life software is produced. However,  you must hand in your own assignments. If found cheating,  you will receive no credit and be subject to college disciplinary action. For more information, refer to your Academic Dishonesty Policy in the college catalog or student handbook.

## Accessibility

Students with documented disabilities requesting class accommodations, requiring special arrangements in case of building evacuation, or having emergency medical information the instructor should know about are asked to contact the disability support services office (DSS) in Rm. 1112. Once the disability is verified with DSS you will be given a letter of accommodation that should be handed to your instructor.
