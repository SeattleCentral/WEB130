## Course Description

Building on existing knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery; students will design and develop a standards-compliant, responsive website. HTML5, CSS3, and advanced JavaScript (client and server side) will be utilized. Emerging web-related technologies, including build systems (gulp) and CSS frameworks (Bootstrap), will be introduced. Students are expected to create a final project to place in their portfolio.

**Prerequisites:** WEB 120 and WEB 150 w/ 2.0 or higher.
 
## Course Goals

Upon Completion of this course, students will be able to:
			
1. Expand on existing knowledge of HTML and CSS.
2. Create professional looking, web standards compliant, responsive websites using HTML5, CSS/CSS3, and JavaScript/jQuery.
3. Use advanced features of HTML5 and JavaScript/jQuery.
3. Expand on existing knowledge of HTML forms to create professional looking forms with client and server side validation.
5. Use CSS and JavaScript frameworks to enhance web pages.
6. Optimize websites for mobile devices using responsive design principles.
7. Understand the basics of Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks.
8. Enhance websites for SEO.

## Assignments/Projects

Regular assignments building up to the final project will be posted in Canvas. All assignments are designed to give the student practice with new skills, concepts, and tools covered in class.

Your homework must be turned in on time. Late submissions may be granted partial credit when accompanied by an ingenuitive excuse. Generally speaking, students will learn more if coursework is up-to-date with the lecture. Unfortunately, assignments turned in after course end will receive 0 points. 

To receive full credit, your completed assignment should perform the required functionality and, if specified, use the techniques learned during class. Additionally, all code must meet coding style guidelines. 

Students will have 1 additional week to correct code rejected for not meeting style guidelines. 

Assignments leading up to the final project will constitute half of the final grade. The final project itself will constitute the remaining half.

## Quizzes/Exams

There may occasionally be quizzes designed to test knowledge retention and evaluate class progression. These will be administered through Canvas and will constitute no more than 10% of the final grade.

As this course is project-based, there will be no exams.

## Evaluation (subject to change)

Evaluation will be based on Assignments, Quizzes, and the Final Project.

## Materials

USB Drive or Cloud Storage and/or Personal Laptop.

An AWS acccount for Cloud9 use. Note: we will attempt to use only resources that qualify for AWS's *free tier*, but if you are already using such resources, then expect to be billed according to the AWS pricing policy. If you absolutely cannot sign up for an AWS account, then contact your instructor for access to shared resources (access will end at the end of quarter). 

## Attendance 

While regular attendance is not technically mandatory, in practice, it usually is. This is by design to mimic “real life” scenarios. Often times, showing up is the most important thing. And being present for lectures, quizzes, and code reviews will greatly improve your grade.  

This is a programming class and you need to be prepared to work hard and to spend an adequate amount of time outside of the classroom coding.   

## Helping / Working with Others

I encourage you to work with other class members, which is how real life software is produced. However,  you must hand in your own assignments. If found cheating,  you will receive no credit and be subject to college disciplinary action. For more information, refer to your Academic Dishonesty Policy in the college catalog or student handbook.

## Accessibility

Students with documented disabilities requesting class accommodations, requiring special arrangements in case of building evacuation, or have emergency medical information the instructor should know about are asked to contact the disability support services office (DSS) in BE1112. Once the disability is verified with DSS the student will be given a letter of accommodation (LOA) to be handed to instructor.

# Americans with Disability Act (ADA) (BE1112)

Students with documented disabilities requesting class accommodations, requiring special arrangements in case of building evacuation, or have emergency medical information the instructor should know about are asked to contact the disability support services office (DSS) in BE1112. Once the disability is verified with DSS the student will be given a letter of accommodation (LOA) to be handed to instructor.

## Accommodation Process:

- If a student contacts the instructor about an accommodation request the instructor will refer the student to the Disability Support Service office in BE1112 for an appointment to discuss accommodation needs.

- If the DSS office determines that the student does indeed have a disability the student will be given a letter of accommodation (LOA) that will state the accommodation to be implemented.

- The student’s responsibility is to hand the LOA to the instructor. The instructor will sign the letter (if there is agreement with the accommodation) and give it back to the student. Student will return the LOA to DSS.
